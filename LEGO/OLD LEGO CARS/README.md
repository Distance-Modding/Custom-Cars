# OLD LEGO CARS
These are all made by GAMEMASTER-THX and they are incompabitle with some of the newer LEGO cars. <br>
If you are using any of these cars they must not be loaded with the newer GAMEMASTER-THX cars. <br>
<br>
Each car also seem to have weird physics that are slightly different to the normal Distance car? It's weird. <br>
Use at your own risk I guess.
