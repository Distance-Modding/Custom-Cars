# Shader for Custom Flame Trail

this is the code used for the Flame.shader file for those who work on custom cars.
Alternatively you can download the [shader file here](https://jumpshare.com/share/vJpP6HUon0aPd2EqlYpg)
but it would most likely be benificial to start a new file and paste in the
code for yourself (just to play it safe)
